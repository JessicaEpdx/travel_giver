Code Review Notes

*Add ENV files to gitignore. Make sure that you commit the addition to gitignore before adding the .env file.

*SimpleCov configuration is needed to have the coverage generated. In the spec helper add (require 'simplecov', and SimpleCov.start).
  *To test the entire project with simplecov, go to the test.rb file in the environment folder, change config.eager_load to true.

* Avoid single word commits (but overall good commit messages!).

* First spec fails ('the add a country process adds a country to the home page')

* 86.42% spec coverage (with config.eager_load set to true)

* Beautiful design! Very easy to navigate, and the map is a nice touch. The only thing I can think of is to provide the user with some sort of confirmation when a payment has been successfully made.

* Allprojects is a somewhat confusing name for a controller - maybe indicate that it's exclusively for the homepage by naming it something like HomeController or RootController.

* Don't use UpperCamelCase for non-global variables (e.g., AsiaCountries, instead: asia_countries, or asiaCountries)

* Consider using scopes in your country model to group countries by continent, instead of doing that in controller.

* country = Country.find(project.country_id) in allprojects index can be refactored as project.country

* create.html.erb for charges is no longer necessary, and can be safely deleted.

* indexs.html.erb for countries: the html for the map would probably be better off in a partial. Kudos for all the scripting!

* nice job with css, and nesting css with SASS!

* old comments about non-working specs can be removed from projects_spec (were removed in this commit)

* consider adding the public images generated with the seeds to gitignore. Then your project will be smaller when pushing to git.
